These are the details for 5ft.

The average cumuluative power for the 5 trials was:

0.002653680983
0.002634498343
0.002236389715
0.002309308341
0.001778262643
+ __________________
0.01161214
sum / 5 = 0.002322429

Odd observation
The average of all the cummulative powers is lower than the 6ft, which is very strange. This goes to show that there is alot of fluctuation when delaing with RSSI values. In theory, the cummulative sum for 5ft should be larger than 6ft since they are closer together, resulting in higher RSSI values and therefore higher power values.
